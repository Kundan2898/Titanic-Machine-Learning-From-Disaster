# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

Overview

This project is focused on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the loss of a significant number of lives. This dataset provides information on the passengers onboard and serves as a valuable resource for exploring patterns of survival.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project, often referred to as the Titanic dataset, contains information about 891 passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set.

Project Structure

data: Contains the dataset files (train.csv and test.csv).

notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

models: Saved machine learning models.

scripts: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
